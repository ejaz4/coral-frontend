            <h1>End of the <span style="color:royalblue">Coral</span> vision.</h1>
            <h4>Published January 24, 2021</h4>
            <p>Coral was ambitious in that we wanted to created a video sharing platform that was respecting of your privacy and your rights. We had great plans for the service, but after some consideration, we do not believe it would be beneficial to continue with Coral at this time for a multitude of reasons.</p>

            <br><h2>Reason One: <span style="color:royalblue">Competition/Market Saturation</span></h2>
            
            <p>The current market for video sharing services is clearly controlled by YouTube, which is currently the second-most popular website by monthly traffic. It is inherently clear that a newcomer website would not be able to dethrone the likes of YouTube or similar services such as Vimeo.</p>
            <br><h2>Reason Two: <span style="color:royalblue">Monetization</span></h2>
            
            <p>It is certain that with Coral's goals of being a privacy-respecting service, monetization becomes a problem. Advertisers use metrics and analytics to help them determine how their advertisements are performing, and they also utilize telemetry from the site they are advertising to generate more clicks and therefore revenue. While it is possible that advertisers could be interested in running adverts while losing out on this extra data, this would result in a much lesser payment to Coral than would be given with more data provided to them. Likewise, Coral with the small hype/movement behind it is practically worthless to advertisers as it is unlikely for many users to see their content.</p>
            
            
            
            <br><p>Coral Video does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.</p>
